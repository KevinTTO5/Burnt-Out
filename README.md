Bugs: Right-clicking makes the crosshair switch to the interactable version, temporarily blocking interactions with objects but this can be fixed by right clicking again. Some objects clip through walls. The player's speed while crouching is slightly faster than the walking speed. 

3rd-party items: We downloaded some miscellaneous assets for free from fab such as office supplies, house items, a modular kitchen, and some random textures.
